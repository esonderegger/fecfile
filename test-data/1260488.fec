Dear Ms. Adame-Wilson:
 
Denton County Republican Party Victory Fund is responding to your request for additional information dated August 30, 2018, regarding reporting in our Amended May Monthly (4/1/18-4/30/18) of an increase in disbursements totaling $29,390.11 from the amounts disclosed on our original report for May Monthly (4/1/18-4/30/18).

Denton County Republican Victory Fund [in its Amended May Monthly (4/1/18-4/30/18)] reported an increase in disbursements totaling $29,390.11 from the amounts disclosed on our original report because a post-filing review by the Denton County Republican Party’s newly appointed First Vice Chair - Finance identified the following clerical mistakes / omissions from the originally filed report:

Those omissions were inadvertent reporting mistakes attributable to transition of clerical employees at the time of the original report.

Respectfully submitted by,
James S. Johnson
